            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: You'll need about a cup of sugar for the cookie dough, plus about two tablespoons of sugar for rolling the dough balls.</li>
                <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the cookies structure and helps create a tender texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Spices</strong>: These soft gingerbread cookies are spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.</li>
                <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it makes the dough rise.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Butter is great for making perfectly soft ginger cookies with slightly crisp edges. If you'd like, you can substitute margarine.</li>

            </ul>
